# Online-Voting
The Online Voting System is a secure and user-friendly web application that enables digital elections. It allows administrators to create and manage elections, add candidates, and monitor live results, while voters can securely cast their votes online.

This project is designed as a group project to demonstrate concepts of web development, database management, and data visualization.
